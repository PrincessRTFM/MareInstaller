This tool is a one-click installer for [Mare Synchronos](https://github.com/Penumbra-Sync/client) and all of its plugin dependencies.

## Usage

1. __Use [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher/) to launch the game.__ You must launch at least once **with Dalamud enabled** in order to set things up, or this tool will not be able to function. You must then **continue to use this launcher** in order for Dalamud to load, which is required for plugins to operate. You should really be using it anyway, since it's a much better launcher than the official one.
2. __Make sure your game is not running.__ This tool modifies configuration files and downloads plugins when necessary. Those changes are obviously external to Dalamud and will not be recognised while the game is running.
3. __Download [the latest build](https://github.com/PrincessRTFM/MareInstaller/releases/latest).__ You will want the `Release.zip` file - `Debug.zip` is purely for debugging and **does not affect your actual game installation**, so it won't do you any good.
4. __Unzip it into an empty folder anywhere on your system.__ It doesn't matter where.
5. __Run `MareInstaller.exe` in that folder and wait for it to finish.__ Downloading the plugin listings and any necessary plugin files may take a few seconds, but probably less than a minute unless you're on dialup.
6. __Launch the game.__ You don't even have to close the installer window if you really don't want to.
7. __Configure any newly installed plugins yourself.__ This tool makes absolutely no changes to plugin configurations. You will need to install your own mods, register a Mare Synchronos account, pair with your friends, whatever. The plugins themselves should be able to help you through that.
